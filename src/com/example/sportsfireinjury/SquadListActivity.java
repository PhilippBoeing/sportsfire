 * An activity representing a list of Squads. This activity has different
 * presentations for handset and tablet-size devices. On handsets, the activity
 * presents a list of items, which when touched, lead to a
 * {@link SquadDetailActivity} representing item details. On tablets, the
 * activity presents the list of items and item details side-by-side using two
 * vertical panes.
 * <p>
 * The activity makes heavy use of fragments. The list of items is a
 * {@link SquadListFragment} and the item details (if present) is a
 * {@link SquadDetailFragment}.
 * <p>
 * This activity also implements the required
 * {@link SquadListFragment.Callbacks} interface to listen for item selections.
